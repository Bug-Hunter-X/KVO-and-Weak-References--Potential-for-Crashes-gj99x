# KVO and Weak References: A Potential Pitfall in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug that can occur when using Key-Value Observing (KVO) with weak references in Objective-C.  If not handled correctly, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

## The Problem

The issue stems from the fact that when an observed object is deallocated, the observer isn't automatically removed from the observation list if it's only holding a weak reference. This can cause problems when the application tries to access methods or properties of the already-deallocated object.

## How to Reproduce

The `KVO_WeakRefBug.m` file demonstrates the bug. Run the code and observe the crash or unexpected behavior.

## The Solution

The `KVO_WeakRefSolution.m` file shows a robust solution which involves removing the observer using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` within the `dealloc` method of the observer. This ensures that the observer is always removed properly even if the observed object is deallocated before the observer.

## Recommendations

* Always remove KVO observers in the `dealloc` method of the observer using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:`. 
* Consider using `@weakify` and `@strongify` macros from libraries like ReactiveCocoa to help avoid retain cycles while safely managing weak references.
