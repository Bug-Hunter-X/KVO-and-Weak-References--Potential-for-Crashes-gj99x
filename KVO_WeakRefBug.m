In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and the use of weak references.  If an object observes another object that's deallocated, and the observer is holding a weak reference to the observed object, the observer might not be automatically removed from the observation list. This can cause crashes or unexpected behavior, especially when the observed object is deallocated.
